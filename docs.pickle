the min h kao department of electrical engineering and computer science was formed in 2007 out of a merger between the computer science and electrical and computer engineering departments
though eecs is relatively new the longestablished departments from which it was created have given it a rich heritage that can be traced back more than 120 years

electrical engineering was first added to the universitys curriculum in the late 19th century around the same time incandescent lighting started illuminating campus charles perkins an associate professor of physics and electrical engineering was the only faculty member teaching electrical engineering courses to a handful of students in 1892 the university graduated its first student sidney albert beyland who received a bachelors in electrical engineering

by 1896 the program was gaining steam with 85 students pursuing electrical engineering degrees the influx of students and the addition of new equipment expanded the universitys electrical laboratory to its limits in science hall the addition of estabrook hall to campus in 1899 made room for a new power plant in addition to experimental labs
in 1907 electrical engineering became its own department perkins who still served as electrical engineerings only faculty member assumed the position of department head he would also teach the departments first graduate course offerings in 1913
in 1942 the united states entrance into world war ii caused a significant drop in the number of students studying electrical engineering at ut during the early years of the war the department was instrumental in training members of the us army air corps following the war enrollment skyrocketed with veterans returning to earn degrees under the gi bill more than 300 undergraduates were enrolled in electrical engineering courses by 1947
in the 1950s computers began appearing on college and university campuses across the country computers became a vital tool in research speeding up the process of calculating complex equations and streamlining the storage of vast amounts of data

electrical engineering faculty members were at the forefront of the universitys new interest in computing science in 1958 department head paul cromwell found a way to bring the first digital computer to campusa librascope general purpose 30bit
as computers became more prevalent demand for computer science courses increased at the time however computer science was still considered a field under electrical engineering and mathematics courses in programming and numerical methods were offered by the department of mathematics while courses on computers continued to be taught through electrical engineering
in 1972 the department of computer science was created to offer a masters degree within the college of liberal arts approximately 150 students enrolled in the program that fall in 1974 the tennessee higher educational commission approved a proposal for an undergraduate degree program to be added to the department a bachelor of arts in computer science the same year robert gregory became the first department head for computer science
during the late 1980s uts computer science department gained national recognition in networking and supercomputing in 198687 the first phd program in computer science was offered professor michael thomason directed the first phd that was awarded to robert england in 1989
throughout the next two decades computer science moved into the top ranks of uts departments in contract and grant funding per fulltime equivalent faculty earning two multiyear nsf infrastructure grants to support its work in parallel computation on multiple processors and grids of shared resources
on july 1 2007 computer science officially merged with electrical and computer engineering to form the department of electrical engineering and computer science

in may 2007 construction began on a sixfloor 150000squarefoot building to house the newly merged department this building was made possible through a generous gift from distinguished alumnus min h kao ceo and chairman of garmin international the department moved in during the fall of 2011 and on march 13 2012 min kao and his family helped mark the buildings grand opening
in 2018 the department officially adopted min h kaos namethe first department at ut to be so honored

 the university of tennessee knoxvilleknoxville tennessee 37996 8659741000 the flagship campus of the university of tennessee system and partner in the tennessee transfer pathway"," the idi describes a set of knowledgeattitudeskill sets or orientations toward cultural difference and commonality that are arrayed along a continuum from the more monocultural mindsets of denial and polarization through the transitional orientation of minimization to the intercultural or global mindsets of acceptance and adaptation the capability of deeply shifting cultural perspective and bridging behavior across cultural differences is most fully achieved when one maintains as adaptation perspective the continuum is adapted from the developmental model of intercultural sensitivity originally proposed by milton bennett a denial mindset reflects a more limited capability for understanding and appropriately responding to cultural differences in values beliefs perceptions emotional responses and behaviors denial consists of a disinterest in other cultures and a more active avoidance of cultural differences individuals with a denial orientation often do not see differences in perceptions and behaviors as cultural a denial orientation is characteristic of individuals who have limited experience with other cultural groups and therefore tend to operate with broad stereotypes and generations about the cultural other those at denial may also maintain a distance from other cultural groups and express little interest in learning about the cultural values and practices of diverse communities this orientation tends to be associated more with members of a dominant culture as well as members of nondominant groups who are relatively isolated from mainstream society because both may have more opportunity to remain relatively isolated from cultural diversity be contrast members of nondominant groups who are more actively engaged within the larger mainstream society are less likely to maintain a denial orientation because they more often need to engage cultural differences when denial is present in the workplace cultural diversity oftentimes feels ignored polarization is an evaluative mindset that views cultural differences from an us verses them perspective polarization can take the form of defense my cultural practices are superior to other cultural practices or reversal other cultures are better than mine within defense cultural differences are often seen as divisive and threatening to ones own way of doing things reversal is a mindset that values and may idealize other cultural practice while denigrating ones own cultural group reversal my also support the cause of an oppressed group but this is done with little knowledge of what the cause means to people from the oppressed community when polarization is present in an organization diversity typically feels uncomfortable minimalization is a transitional mindset between the more monocultural orientations of denial and polarization and the more interculturalglobal worldviews of acceptance and adaptation minimalization highlights commonalities in both human similarity basic needs and universalism universal values and principals that can mask a deeper understanding of cultural differences minimization can take one of two forms a the highlighting of commonalities due to limited cultural selfunderstanding which is more commonly experienced by dominant group members within a cultural community or b the highlighting of commonalities as a strategy for navigating the values and practices largely determined by the dominant culture group which is more often experienced by nondominant group members within a larger cultural community this latter strategy can have survival value for nondominant culture members and often takes the form of go along to get along when minimalization exists in organizations diversity often feels not heard acceptance and adaptation are interculturalglobal mindsets with an acceptance orientation individuals recognize and appreciate patterns of cultural difference and commonality in their own and other cultures an acceptance orientation is curious to learn how a cultural pattern of behavior makes sense within different cultural communities this involves contrastive selfreflection between ones own culturally learned perceptions and behaviors and perceptions and practices of different cultural groups while curious individuals with an acceptance mindset are not fully able to appropriately adapt to cultural differences someone with an acceptance orientation may be challenged as well to make ethical or moral decisions across cultural groups while a person within acceptance embraces a deeper understanding of cultural differences this can lead to the individual struggling with reconciling behavior in another cultural group that the person considers unethical or immoral from his or her own cultural viewpoint when acceptance is present in organizations and educational institutions diversity feels understood an adaptation orientation consists of both cognitive frameshifting shifting ones cultural perspective and behavioral codeshifting changing behavior in authentic and culturally appropriate ways adaptation enables deep cultural bridging across diverse communities using an increased repertoire of cultural frameworks and practices in navigating cultural commonalities and differences an adaptation mindset sees adaptation in performance behavior while people with an adaptation mindset typically focus on learning adaptive strategies problems can arise when people with adaptation mindsets express little tolerance toward people who engage diversity from other developmental orientations this can result in people with adaptive capabilities being marginalized in their workplace when an adaptation mindset is present in the workplace diversity feels valued and involved

pathway","appropriateinappropriate areas of inquiry pdf interviewing candidates and checking references are critical steps in the hiring process in an effort to provide guidance to members of search committees interviewers and those involved in reference checks the following suggestions and information are provided avoid questions or inquiries into age the age discrimination act prohibits discrimination against applicants age 40 and over on the basis of age this means that anyone over the age of 40 is protected by this law as a general rule there are no acceptable inquiries regarding age under the americans with disabilities act the ada an employer is prohibited from asking about an applicants disabilities either directly or indirectly for example an employer cannot ask about an applicants medical history whether an applicant is disabled or about the nature of any obvious disabilities prior to the ada employers often asked applicants whether they had any physical or mental disabilities that would substantially limit the ability to perform the essential functions of the job this is no longer allowed under the ada however you may still ask whether an applicant has the ability to perform the essential functions of the job with no reference to physical or mental impairments or disabilities the university no longer includes handicap or disability status on its affirmative action selfidentification form for data purposes please check with oed if you have any questions about whether you are distributing the most uptodate version of the form the ada also limits prehire medical exams with certain types of jobs an employer can require a medical exam after an applicant has been hired this issue will come up very rarely in the hiring of exempt staff and faculty at the university however if it does the hiring department should contact hr before instituting such a requirement the ada requires that employers reasonably accommodate applicants with disabilities unless the reasonable accommodation would cause an undue hardship to the business for example an interviewer might have to provide a guide to a blind applicant who has been invited to interview note the ada covers many issues that may arise during the course of employment of an individual with disabilities it would be impossible to cover all of the potential issues here departments with questions should contact the universitys ada coordinator at the human resources office hr at 9742456 making employment decisions based on a candidates gender is illegal with very few bona fide exceptions under title vii and the pregnancy discrimination act many inappropriate areas of inquiry relate to gender issues you may ask whether the candidate is available for weekend or evening work so long as both male and female candidates are asked and there is a true business need for the information ie performing the job requires weekend and evening hours be careful to avoid inquiries into religious practices that might occur during these times avoid inquiries relating to pregnancy future childbearing plans or the number or ages of the candidates children in the past some employers have had policies of hiring men but not women who have preschool age children based on an assumption that the woman would be responsible for the care of the children thus resulting in more absences avoid questions about marital status or a spouses job you may ask in general terms whether an applicant has any commitments or responsibilities that would preclude the applicant from regularly meeting work schedules avoid all questions of this nature federal and state civil rights laws and university nondiscrimination policies make it unlawful to discriminate on the basis of raceethnicitycolor avoid all questions of this nature civil rights laws make it unlawful to discriminate against an applicant on the basis of religious denomination beliefs and practices as mentioned under citizenship avoid questions about an applicants national origin it violates civil rights laws to discriminate against an applicant because of his or her lineage ancestry descent country of birth or national origin if the job legitimately requires the ability to read write or speak a foreign language or english it is permissible to inquire whether the applicant has these skills citizenship this can be a very confusing area on one hand an employer is required by federal law to hire only those who are legally allowed to work in the united states on the other hand federal civil rights laws prohibit any discrimination on the basis of national origin ie you cant decide not to hire someone only because heshe comes from another country to be safe you may ask whether an applicant is lawfully authorized to work in the us avoid all other questions regarding citizenship until after an offer of employment is made at that point if the offer is accepted you are then required to request proof that the employee is legally able to work in the us avoid questions about this possibility civil rights laws prohibit retaliation against an applicant because he or she has filed a discrimination charge or testified assisted or participated in a discrimination investigation or proceeding do not confuse this prohibition with whether it is proper or improper to consider true information from a previous employer about someone with a record of engaging in discrimination obviously it is proper to ascertain whether an applicant has the proper educational credentials for the position you may verify types and dates of degrees earned you may consider where applicants have worked length of prior employment specific jobs held and actual tasks skills and responsibilities performed in previous employment you may also consider the applicants record in regard to punctuality and attendance as well as work quality and quantity you may consider why the applicant no longer works for the previous employer and whether the termination was voluntary you may also ask applicants to explain periods of unemployment avoid any requirement that a photograph accompany an employment application avoid all questions on this topic many search committees on campus find that it is most useful to limit reference checks to those candidates identified as being in the primary pool or in both the primary and alternate pools when the committee is at the point of checking references it is a good idea to consider what information the group deems important to receive from the references questions should be consistently asked of the references for the different candidates often a candidate or a candidates reference will voluntarily provide information that may be inappropriate if this happens the interviewer or the person checking the reference should include only that information received that is appropriate to consider in determining whether a candidate is qualified for the position reference checks must be completed before hiring successful candidates

safety culture your efforts will serve you well protect others serve as an example and prepare you for the expectations of professional life as an engineer instructor researcher or other professional we are all essential persons in the continuous process to sustain a safe laboratory working environment again thank you all very much for your support and efforts to assist the development and maintenance of laboratory safety culture for our research and instructional laboratories maker spaces and workshops look below for an overview of the responsibilities for tce personnel working in laboratories as a function of your role each department has a designated laboratory safety advocate this person is a safety advocate who helps address your questions or directs you toward the appropriate resource contact information for your laboratory safety advocate can be found at the bottom of this page leaders of instructional labs as the leader of an instructional laboratory you supervise and manage a laboratory space with large groups of students and are responsible for the experimental activity taking place thus you are responsible for ensuring that the environment is safe and that the students and other instructors are following safe practices the space may also be used for research activities but those activities will fall under the responsibility of the research leader the following training requirements are to be completed by you it is then your responsibility to share this knowledge with your students  leaders of research labs as leader of a research lab you play a critical role in ensuring that safety and safe behaviors are a constant presence in the laboratory research of your group  ideally you serve as a role model for all of the persons in your research group in terms of safe practices for labbased research you are ultimately responsible for the health and safety of everyone who enters your labs to this end  postdocs research staff and research faculty in research labs postdoctoral researchers research staff and research faculty engage in a wide range of leadership and individual research activities in labs from daily work in the lab to leading undergraduate and graduate student research these members of the college play a pivotal role in building and maintaining safety culture frequently members of this group have come to tce from other institutions providing the opportunity for new ideas and best practices to be introducedplease share those experiences with your group below are several of the key responsibilities that apply to research faculty and staff along with brief explanations of those responsibilities and links to ehs resources that will aid you note that some may be covered by the leader of the research lab while others may be delegated to other lab members  graduate research and teaching assistants in research labs as a gragta you are typically in the laboratory on a daily basis and are very often the main daytoday participant in the research work of the lab thus you are in many ways most responsible for ensuring that the work environment is safe a key part of this effort is to discuss safety matters with your lab research leader and other members of the research group to develop the needed understanding of standard laboratory operating procedures sops lab equipment and potentially hazardous laboratory materials on that basis an appropriate array of training requirements should be completed by you to ensure that you are ready to do your work safely in the laboratory setting  undergraduates in research labs performing research as an undergraduate can be both an exciting and rewarding experiential learning endeavor but it is imperative to first learn how to conduct work safely and carefully  minors in research laboratories see undergraduates in research labs the university regulates policies involving minors in research labs the excerpts below were taken from applicable university policies and are provided for informational purposes only it is your responsibility to review the source documents and ensure compliance with the most up to date university regulations this policy applies to minors who are not enrolled as a university student and are on campus attending governors school stem academy classes camps or are otherwise present in laboratories shops or other areas that contain hazardous substances or physical hazards this policy does not contemplate or authorize a minor who is not enrolled in the university as a student to be hired as a university employee approval of the appropriate department head is required to hire a nonuniversity student under the age of eighteen 18 as a university employee minors visit campuses and institutes of the university of tennessee system for a variety of reasons and are involved in a variety of programs and activities sponsored by the university or by third parties using university facilities or resources the aim of this policy is to promote a safe environment for minors by fostering a university culture that is committed to preventing recognizing reporting and addressing child abuse and child sexual abuse  standard operating procedures and chemical hygiene plans standard operating procedures sops and chemical hygiene plans chps serve as the touchstone for all laboratory operations

position an academic position in another university or a nonacademic position in a relevant technical field the college has guidelines for faculty appointments with tenure which are summarized below in these cases the expectation is that the vetting and evaluation of the candidate during the hiring process substitutes for the regular tenure procedureduring the hiring process the tenured faculty in the hiring unit should have ample opportunity and information to evaluate the candidate to vote on whether expedited tenure is appropriate and to make a recommendation to the other decision makers

the department college and campus points of decision making remain intacthowever the decisions are usually made based upon an expedited dossier and in a shorter time period in the absence of a fully developed dossier an expedited dossier should be assembled and forwarded to the chief academic officer either at the time of the request to make an offer or shortly thereafter the expedited dossier typically includes the following materials this dossier is submitted to the chief academic officer for review and recommendation to the chancellor and the chancellor will make a recommendation to the board of trustees in the event of a positive decision the university and the college have guidelines for the promotion of nontenure track faculty many relevant university policies and procedures are documented in the faculty handbook the universitys faculty handbook is being updated as of fall 2017 to use the same guidelines for all nontenure track promotions ie for both teachingintensive

spent five weeks in london england studying thermodynamics and circuits students learned about the origin of the industrial revolution the second industrial revolution of electrical machines and the birth of the computer age through visits to important historical locations in the region below are firsthand accounts of several students adventures abroad hello my name is derrick bailey i am a rising sophomore majoring in aerospace engineering at the tickle college of engineering i had the opportunity to go on the engineering in london trip this summer during this trip i was able to experience many things and see the amazing marvels of past engineers learning abroad teaches you much more than a typical classroom experience anyone can pick up a book and take the time to learn one of these subjects studying abroad shows the realworld applications of what you are learning and lets you meet people whose lives revolve around what you are learning a prime example of this was when we went to the london water and steam museum at kew bridge at the museum we were led by a man named richard richard had been volunteering and working at the museum since he was 13 years old as he took us around we really got a feel for how these giant machines worked and their significance in human history the difference between seeing on paper how something works and actually viewing it in person is astronomical and significantly contributes to your understanding of a topic we also got to visit places unrelated to the course my favorite place we visited was saint pauls cathedral saint pauls is the most beautiful building i have ever seen its design is magnificent and it captivates you even across the river thames however my favorite part about saint pauls isnt how it looks it was what our tour guide told us apparently during the second world war every day the first place churchill would ask about when the previous days damage was reported was saint pauls cathedral churchill believed that if saint pauls was to fall then the hope of the british people would also fall this idea of the hope engineering can give to people really stuck with me and made me think about all the other hopes and trusts people put into engineers work it made me really realize the importance of being an engineer  hello my name is ariel lane i am a junior majoring in mechanical engineering with a minor in biomedical engineering i was granted the opportunity to be a student in the engineering in london study abroad program partially due to the generous contributions of all the sponsors throughout the program we were taken to many different memorable museums parks and other locations around london the city grasped my attention due to it being so well preserved most of the individual places we visited captured my attention due to the rich history that correlates between science engineering and some of the most famous inventions used throughout world history the one place we visited that really intrigued me was the national museum of science this museum was so fascinating to me because it had so many exhibits revolving around things that i am interested in the first thing that caught my eye was a space exhibit that detailed all the different technological advancements in the space race next there were displays that showed the various improvements of the locomotives that were used in cars and then space machines another exhibit that i found interesting was the science and technology exhibit it included things like a collection of pendulum clocks an enigma machine and babbages 2 difference engine lastly the exhibit that i spent most of my time in was the medical exhibit many different displays caught my attention on this floor there were things like the first mri machine a portable xray machine the beginning of the birth control pill era and the original methods of medical procedures the exhibits in this museum all sum up my many different interests in engineering even though i am interested in aerospace and other technological fields i chose to minor in biomedical engineering because i have more of a determination to help others and a curiosity of the way the human body functions  because of eil i got to visit scotland my family lineage can be traced back to the city of edinburgh scotland more specifically i am a descendant of robert the bruce who is an important historical figure of scotland he was the king of scots for 23 years and he can be found on one of two statues on the front of edinburgh castle one also might recognize the name from the movie braveheart in which he was one of the antagonists because of all of this scotland was the one place that i wanted to venture out to during this trip i knew i would like edinburgh but it was highly gratifying to have loved the city even more than i thought i was going to not only did i spend time in the city of edinburgh i also went on a 12hour bus tour of the scottish highlands i had absolutely no idea that scotland had such magnificent and towering mountains this unbelievable landscape expanded my love for this country even more than i thought possible and at this point i almost want to move to edinburgh and go backpacking through the highlands every weekend i am definitely going to be coming back to visit again at the very least and it makes me so proud to have come from this beautiful country  as an aerospace engineering student one of the most influential places we visited was the london museum of water steam there we witnessed the first real engines that humanity has ever made gigantic steam engines that pumped water out of mines and clean water through cities this wasnt just an idle museum tour we saw these machines whirl to life and it was aweinspiring to see these ancient beasts work their magic with mechanical engineering being the foundation for my major it is remarkable to see the initial spark of what would become such a broad important field now to a more modern era f1 racing compared to the cumbersome pieces of machinery that were the old steam engines these modern engines are much leaner smaller and have a fantastic roar to them we got lucky that the british grand prix fell right in the middle of our program four of us were able to go up to silverstone circuit we were able to not only watch these cars go around but to also compare them to cars in other programs like the f2 and w series seeing just how much faster f1 cars are than these already fast race cars shows just how much time and energy gets poured into engineering these beasts to be the fastest machines on earth 








 on saturday the 17th a group of students and i traveled to the silverstone circuit in northampton to watch the f1 race i have never been to a race and had no idea what to expect being around the track at a soldout event was super exciting and seeing the engineering marvels that are the f1 cars was unreal we participated in a competition where we were pit crews racing other pit crews we changed a tire in 2821 seconds 021 seconds off the weekend leaderboard and first in our group we watched a classic car race and the f2 race there was also a battle of britain memorial flight where we got to see restored supermarine spitfires then finally we watched the f1 qualifier the speed and the noise from those cars is something which can only be experienced to its fullest in person we even saw the start of a crash which is amazing it was a full day which i was thoroughly exhausted from  if i had to summarize this trip in one word it would be encouraging this past year and a half have been sad and uninspiring especially for kids in college who gain so much from just being oncampus learning and making connections sitting at home staring at a computer screen for hours almost every day trying to learn through a video conference where everyone has internet connection issues can burn out anyone at first i enjoyed being at home but i soon felt the burnout and just started wishing campus would open up again its been over a year since i had a real class and coming to london this summer made me excited to learn again having an inperson lecture where i can really engage with the students and professors encouraged me to work hard and start experiencing real life again instead of just sitting at home like ive gotten so used to doing along with encouraging me to work hard in school again this trip encouraged me to step out of my comfort zone ive never really been the type of person to go out and explore all the time or participate in group activities i really value my alone time but i tried something different in london i went out every day whether it was by myself or with a group and i ate different kinds of food listened to new music and developed a sudden new interest in steam engines overall this trip has encouraged me to keep going because better days are ahead where i can meet even more people and learn some amazing things 








 while we were able to visit many different interesting sites during our engineering in london study abroad program one site really stood out to me this site was kew bridge steam museum our tour of kew bridge steam museum was very interesting and extensive with our tour guide explaining the engineering and history behind all the steam engines in the museum during this tour we were able to see rotative engines in action having learned about the history of steam engines during our thermodynamics lectures it was amazing to see the designs of these centuries old steam engines still working we were also able to see the allen diesel engine while on the tour along with visiting old blacksmith shops that were devastated by bombs during the world wars the real eyeopening experience of this tour though was being able to see the cornish engines specifically the bull engine the grand junction 90 inch engine and the grand junction 100 inch engine the bull engine was restored to working order and it was a spectacle to see in action while the bull engine was not working as fast as it normally would back in the nineteenth century it was still crazy to see how quickly the bull steam engine could move such a large weight being able to see the bull engine from different angles on different floors allowed me to see all the different components and dynamics of the engine additionally the grand junction 90 inch engine and grand junction 100 inch engine was one of my favorite moments of the tour the sheer size of these engines was amazing to see having to climb several floors up to see the top of the engine i was able to see how the massive scale of these engines while the engines were no longer in use it was still amazing to think that engines that big were being used centuries ago this study abroad has really helped reinforce my decision to become an engineer being able to see such important engineering innovations in person on this trip has showed me how important the work engineers do is learning thermodynamics and circuits and seeing and touring different historical engineering sites combined with building friendships and connections with my professors and classmates has made this study abroad an experience that i will never forget i had never thought that i wanted to do a study abroad program i saw an email that ut offered two classes that were required for my major in london i thought huh this would be a fun opportunity so i decided to apply and go through the process the pandemic did put a damper on things and i must say that i questioned if this was right for me after this trip i feel like i understand thinking like an engineer so much better such a personalized experience with circuits and thermodynamics allowed me to excel in my classes whether it is working through circuit problems or figuring out the efficiency of an engine i feel confident that dr berry and dr parsons have helped me to become a better engineer being in london and getting to see machines that are the genesis of engineering really allowed me to understand all of the problems that we face today to see the bombe machine in action was absolutely fascinating turing helped so much in the advancement of computers and i think that sometimes people do not see how far we have come as a society my favorite things to see were the steam engines these behemoths of machines were not that efficient but they are the predecessors to all engines today to see a fourstory tall cornish steam engine is unbelievable to think that those things moved at one point is a testament to mankind and all of our advancements ive made wonderful friends along the way through this program and have thoroughly enjoyed my time in london i would recommend studying abroad to anyone who is in college and special thanks to jim crum and international paper for funding my extravagant vacation  the engineering in london program has been such a great opportunity for me to complete my courses through a historical perspective the history of the industrial revolution brings these engineering principles to life my favorite place we visited was in kew the london museum of water and steam the massive steam engines were so fascinating to see and they demonstrated the process we have been learning about in our class the largest steam engine at the museum was the grand junction ninetyinch engine it was stretching four stories high and was built within a house as a mechanical engineering student it was very encouraging to get to see the engines of the past studying great inventions and learning about inventors inspired me within my own career path as a mechanical engineer i am very thankful for the opportunity to spend my summer in london studying engineering  my name is dean vookles and i am an electrical engineering major in my junior year of college during our stay in england we visited many museums and historical landmarks many of them were spectacular but only some gave you a vague idea of what engineering was like in the past i say that because it is hard to imagine the actual design process when viewing it all as finished engines machines and bridges therefore my favorite part of our museum visits is when we went into the workshops of the london museum of water steam when you walk into the workshop you can see there is a coat of rust and dust stuck to everything in sight the age on these objects varies some showing recent use and some showing years of neglect all the machines still runon enginepowered belts lined across the ceiling while inside you could imagine a wwii engineer cutting down parts for a tank or even a mechanic boring holes into pipes for a steam engine that is why this trip is special we get to have a tactile and visual exploration of the history of engineering in london  my name is dylan sullenberger i am a junior computer science major with a minor in mathematics this summer i was given the opportunity to participate in the engineering in london program i was honored to be part of such a program and it is one of the most lifechanging experiences i have ever had i got to see and do so many things in london that i would not have gotten to do had it not been for this program the city is home to some of the coolest places i have ever been to in particular we went to a few museums and landmarks that were directly related to the subjects that we were studying at the time and it was very impactful and helpful to be able to connect what we were learning in class to what we were seeing in london my favorite place we toured was bletchley park the site where alan turing and his team cracked the german enigma machine among other german codes during world war ii we got to see a working bombe machine the machine turing invented to break the enigma code as well as many early computer models while we were there as a computer science major this directly related to a lot of things i have learned over the years and it was always a dream of mine to see it in person i could not be more grateful for the opportunity that i have been given to be part of this trip and i absolutely recommend lots of people to try to take part in the trip in the future
